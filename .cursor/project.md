# Porch Records Website Revamp

## Background / Why
Porch Records is an independent record label, physical record store, live-music promoter, and creative studio based in Adelaide. Their existing site (porchrecords.com.au) is dated and does not represent the brand's forward-thinking curation, nor does it integrate with the in-store Square POS that runs daily sales. A modern, unified web presence is required to showcase releases, sell records & merch online, promote live shows and communicate the broader creative work carried out at Summertown Studio.

The goal is to create a professional yet creative energy, to elevate & showcase our future, existing & previous work. The site should be more than just functional; it should be edgy and reflective of the music, brands and labels they represent.

## Purpose / Goals
1.  **Re-launch porchrecords.com.au** with a fresh, visually striking design that still feels warm & community-oriented.
2.  **Launch an Online Store:**
    *   Powered by the existing **Square POS** to keep inventory synced.
    *   Sell vinyl (Jazz, Funk, Soul, Hip Hop, international grooves) and merchandise.
    *   Feature a **unique online sorting system** (e.g., "Porch Picks," "Kitchen Boogies," "Island Time").
    *   Support **pre-orders**.
    *   Explore retailing turntables and accessories.
3.  **Showcase Live Shows:**
    *   Archive of past show posters.
    *   Embed a **Humanitix Widget** for upcoming show ticket sales.
4.  **Feature Summertown Studio:**
    *   Provide a brief overview of the space and its music elements (Winetime, Duck Radio, etc.).
5.  **Create a DJs Page:**
    *   A holding page for venues where Porch Records DJs frequently play (e.g., Latteria, Oddio) and upcoming dates.
6.  **Tell Our Story:**
    *   An "About" page detailing who Porch Records are and their mission.
7.  **Enable In-House Management:**
    *   Allow the Porch team to manage stock, orders, and make small site changes independently.
8.  **Complete E-commerce Experience:**
    *   Customer authentication and account management via Square only (no local storage of credentials or PII).
    *   Shopping cart functionality (non-sensitive data only).
    *   Complete Square checkout integration (all payment data handled by Square).
    *   Order management and tracking via Square.
    *   Admin order management interface (Square Dashboard or secure API only).
9.  **Make Site Fully Configurable:**
    *   **Homepage Configuration**: Extend current hero image management to include configurable sections below the hero
    *   **Global Theme Configuration**: Allow customization of fonts, colors, and overall site styling
    *   **Page Builder Integration**: Leverage existing PageBuilder system for homepage sections
    *   **Style Consistency**: Ensure all customer-facing pages use configurable styling system
