# SEO-Friendly Product URLs Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented SEO-friendly product URLs that use product names instead of Square IDs. This makes URLs more readable, memorable, and better for SEO.

## What Changed

### Before
- URLs: `/store/square_WLVTWLJDBY6Y45JKKXPA3FDL`
- Hard to read and remember
- Not SEO-friendly

### After
- URLs: `/store/kizza`, `/store/test-api-response`, `/store/no-inventory`
- Clean, readable, and memorable
- SEO-friendly with product names

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `slug` column to the `products` table
- Created indexes for fast slug lookups
- Added unique constraint to prevent duplicate slugs

### 2. Slug Generation
- Created `src/lib/slug-utils.ts` with utility functions
- Slugs are generated from product title + artist name
- Handles special characters, spaces, and duplicates
- Limited to 60 characters for URL compatibility

### 3. Routing Updates
- Updated `/store/[slug]/page.tsx` to handle both slug and ID lookups
- Updated API routes to support slug-based queries
- Maintains backward compatibility with old ID-based URLs

### 4. Component Updates
- Updated all product links to use `product.slug || product.id`
- Modified `ProductCard`, `StoreHighlights`, `LatestReleases` components
- Updated search utilities to use slug-based URLs

## Examples

### New URLs
- `http://localhost:3000/store/kizza` (instead of `/store/square_64I4YL5VZXNA3SYNLKGXRBT3`)
- `http://localhost:3000/store/test-api-response` (instead of `/store/square_TAY7GQZEWWVPIVRVG5WXF7BF`)
- `http://localhost:3000/store/no-inventory` (instead of `/store/square_XWBBKLLMS7RPAXMXLMXDQHMG`)

### Backward Compatibility
- Old ID-based URLs still work: `/store/square_WLVTWLJDBY6Y45JKKXPA3FDL`
- Both slug and ID lookups are supported
- No breaking changes for existing links

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `src/lib/slug-utils.ts` - Slug generation utilities
- `scripts/generate-product-slugs.js` - Script to generate slugs for existing products
- `scripts/test-slug-urls.js` - Test script for slug functionality
- `scripts/add-slug-to-products.sql` - Database migration script

### Updated Files
- `src/app/store/[slug]/page.tsx` - New route handler
- `src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` - Updated to support slug lookups
- `src/app/api/store/products/route.ts` - Added slug field to responses
- `src/app/api/store/sync-and-get-products/route.ts` - Generate slugs for new products
- `src/lib/types.ts` - Added slug field to StoreProduct interface
- `src/components/ProductCard.tsx` - Updated links to use slugs
- `src/components/HomepageSections/StoreHighlights.tsx` - Updated links
- `src/components/HomepageSections/LatestReleases.tsx` - Updated links
- `src/lib/search-utils.ts` - Updated search result URLs
- `src/lib/search-server.ts` - Updated search result URLs

## How It Works

### Slug Generation
1. Takes product title and artist name
2. Converts to lowercase
3. Replaces special characters and spaces with hyphens
4. Removes duplicate hyphens
5. Limits to 60 characters
6. Ensures uniqueness by appending numbers if needed

### URL Resolution
1. First tries to find product by slug
2. If not found, falls back to ID lookup (backward compatibility)
3. Returns 404 if neither works

### New Product Sync
1. When syncing from Square, generates unique slug for new products
2. Updates existing products with slugs if they don't have one
3. Maintains slug consistency across syncs

## Benefits

1. **SEO Improvement**: URLs now contain relevant keywords
2. **User Experience**: URLs are readable and memorable
3. **Social Sharing**: Better URLs for social media sharing
4. **Analytics**: Cleaner URL structure for tracking
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing links continue to work

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
node scripts/test-slug-urls.js
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Slugs**: Allow admin to manually set custom slugs
2. **Slug History**: Track slug changes for redirects
3. **Bulk Slug Update**: Tool to regenerate all slugs
4. **Slug Validation**: Additional validation rules for slugs
